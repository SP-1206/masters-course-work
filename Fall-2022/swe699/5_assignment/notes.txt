Part 1: Operating System
Due by end of the day on November 6 - submit via Dropbox.
For this assignment, you will need to use a real-time operating system. 
Your options include patching the built-in Debian distribution on the Beagle with the PREEMPT_RT kernel; 
using Yocto to build a custom distribution for the Beagle (must include a real-time kernel); 
use a FreeRTOS or RTEMS distribution for the Beagle.

Rubric for Part 1:
Documentation for how you configured/built the operating system.  This must be sufficient to duplicate your process during our testing. (50 pts)
Boot OS on the Beagle and provide a screenshot with teammember names, machine name, and OS (like your first QEMU assignment). (50 pts)
Include an image file that we can flash to an SD card for verification (Google if you don't know how to do this).  (25 pts)
DISREGARD the image upload - this is going to be too taxing for the network and for my Dropbox when multiplied to the 28 groups.
Successful use (and documentation) of Yocto, FreeRTOS, or RTEMS: +10pts (i.e. going beyond the minimum of simply using the PREEMPT_RT patch)
