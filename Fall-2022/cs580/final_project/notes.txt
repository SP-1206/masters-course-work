    Project 5: Adversarial Search (Connect 4). Due Midnight the evening of Saturday, December 3. There's no late-submission option: it's a GMU hard deadline.

    You will fill out the template.lisp file with your code and rename it as firstname-lastname.lisp, and that's what you'll send to the TA. For example, mine would be called sean-luke.lisp. This file relies on code from connectfour.lisp (you will not modify the connectfour.lisp file nor will you send it to us, we already have it thanks).

    After all the submissions have been received we will grade the assignments but we will ALSO hold a single-elimination connect-four tournament. The winner will receive a bump in his overall course grade.

    To understand this project you'll need to know about two new things: (1) setf functions and (2) packages/namespaces and symbols. It would also be helpful to know about compiler optimization.
